\section*{EXERCISE - 7.2}
\begin{enumerate}

\item An urn contains 5 red and 5 black balls. A ball is drawn at random, its colour is
noted and is returned to the urn. Moreover, 2 additional balls of the colour drawn
are put in the urn and then a ball is drawn at random. What is the probability that
the second ball is red?
\item A bag contains 4 red and 4 black balls, another bag contains 2 red and 6 black
balls. One of the two bags is selected at random and a ball is drawn from the bag
which is found to be red. Find the probability that the ball is drawn from the
first bag.

\item Of the students in a college, it is known that 60\% reside in hostel and 40\% are
day scholars (not residing in hostel). Previous year results report that 30\% of all
students who reside in hostel attain A grade and 20\% of day scholars attain A
grade in their annual examination. At the end of the year, one student is chosen
at random from the college and he has an A grade, what is the probability that the
student is a hostlier?     
      
\item In answering a question on a multiple choice test, a student either knows the
answer or guesses. Let
$\frac{3}{4}$ be the probability that he knows the answer and
$\frac{1}{4}$
be the probability that he guesses. Assuming that a student who guesses at the
answer will be correct with probability
$\frac{1}{4}$. What is the probability that the student knows the answer given that he answered it correctly?
\item A laboratory blood test is 99\% effective in detecting a certain disease when it is
in fact, present. However, the test also yields a false positive result for 0.5\% of
the healthy person tested (i.e. if a healthy person is tested, then, with probability
0.005, the test will imply he has the disease). If 0.1 percent of the population
actually has the disease, what is the probability that a person has the disease
given that his test result is positive ?
\item There are three coins. One is a two headed coin (having head on both faces),
another is a biased coin that comes up heads 75\% of the time and third is an
unbiased coin. One of the three coins is chosen at random and tossed, it shows
heads, what is the probability that it was the two headed coin ?

\item An insurance company insured 2000 scooter drivers, 4000 car drivers and 6000
truck drivers. The probability of an accidents are 0.01, 0.03 and 0.15 respectively.
One of the insured persons meets with an accident. What is the probability that
he is a scooter driver?
\item A factory has two machines A and B. Past record shows that machine A produced
60\% of the items of output and machine B produced 40\% of the items. Further,
2\% of the items produced by machine A and 1\% produced by machine B were
defective. All the items are put into one stockpile and then one item is chosen at
random from this and is found to be defective. What is the probability that it was
produced by machine B?

\item. Two groups are competing for the position on the Board of directors of a
corporation. The probabilities that the first and the second groups will win are
0.6 and 0.4 respectively. Further, if the first group wins, the probability of
introducing a new product is 0.7 and the corresponding probability is 0.3 if the
second group wins. Find the probability that the new product introduced was by
the second group.
\item Suppose a girl throws a die. If she gets a 5 or 6, she tosses a coin three times and
notes the number of heads. If she gets 1, 2, 3 or 4, she tosses a coin once and
notes whether a head or tail is obtained. If she obtained exactly one head, what
is the probability that she threw 1, 2, 3 or 4 with the die?]
\item A manufacturer has three machine operators A, B and C. The first operator A
produces 1\% defective items, where as the other two operators B and C produce 5\% and 7\% defective items respectively. A is on the job for 50\% of the
time, B is on the job for 30\% of the time and C is on the job for 20\% of the time.
A defective item is produced, what is the probability that it was produced by A?
\item A card from a pack of 52 cards is lost. From the remaining cards of the pack,
two cards are drawn and are found to be both diamonds. Find the probability of
the lost card being a diamond.
\item Probability that A speaks truth is
$\frac{4}{5}$ . A coin is tossed. A reports that a head
appears. The probability that actually there was head is
\\(A) $\frac{4}{5}$ \hspace{2cm} (B) $\frac{1}{2}$ \hspace{2cm} (C) $\frac{1}{5}$ \hspace{2cm} (D) $\frac{2}{5}$
\item If A and B are two events such that $A \subset B$ and $P(B) \neq 0$, then which of the
following is correct?
\\
\\
(A) $P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(B)}{P(A)}$ \hspace{2cm} (B) $P(A \mid B)<P(A)$
\\
\\
(C) $P(A \mid B) \geq P(A)$ \hspace{2cm} (D) None of these
